        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a,b,c;
        System.out.println("Enter x");
        a=sc.nextInt();

        b=sc.nextInt();
         System.out.println("Enter z");
        c=sc.nextInt();
        if(a<b && a<c)
        {
             System.out.println("L1 has the minimal seating capacity");
        }
        else if(b<a && b<c)
        {
             System.out.println("L2 has the minimal seating capacity");
        }
